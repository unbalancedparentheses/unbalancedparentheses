### Federico Carrone

Founder of [Ergodic Group](https://federicocarrone.com) — builds and holds companies in distributed systems, cryptography, AI, gaming, and real assets. Creator of [LambdaClass](https://lambdaclass.com), a software company focused on protocol engineering, systems programming, and formal verification. Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I write about the systems that shape the future: cryptographic infrastructure, institutional design, and the culture that emerges from both.
